It is important to realize that the \"Regular Season\" games are simply defined to be all games played on DayNum=132 or earlier (DayNum=133 is Selection Monday). Thus a game played before Selection Monday will show up here whether it was a pre-season tournament, a non-conference game, a regular conference game, a conference tournament game, or whatever.\n",

For example, the first game in the file was DayNum=18. Combined with the fact from the \"WSeasons.csv\" file that day zero was 10/27/1997 that year, this means the first game was played 18 days later, or 11/14/1997. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID).\n",
